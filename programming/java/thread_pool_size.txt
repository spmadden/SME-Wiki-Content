===Number of Threads for an optimized thread pool ===

  * $N_{cpu}$ = Number of Available CPUs
  * $U_{cpu}$ = Target utilization of those CPUs (0 <= $U_{cpu}$ <= 1)
  * $W_c$ = Ratio of Wait time / Compute time

Following the formula: $ N_{threads} = N_{cpu} * U_{cpu} * (1 - W_c)$

You can determine the number of CPUs using Runtime:

<code java>
int N_CPUS = Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors();
</code>
