A few days ago, John Perry Barlow twetted a series of Adult Principles, and I enjoyed reading them. When he was asked where they came from, he said:

They're from a list I assembled for myself on the eve of my 30th birthday. Many years ago.
This is the collected set from his twitter feed:

Adult Principle #1: Be patient. No matter what.

Adult Principle #2: Don?t badmouth: Assign responsibility, not blame. Say nothing of another you wouldn't say to him.

Adult Principle #3: Never assume the motives of others are, to them, less noble than yours are to you.

Adult Principle #4 Expand your sense of the possible.

Adult Principle #5 Don?t trouble yourself with matters you truly cannot change.

Adult Principle #6 Don't ask more of others than you can deliver yourself.

Adult Principle #7 Tolerate ambiguity.

Adult Principle #8 Laugh at yourself frequently.

Adult Principle #9 Concern yourself with what is right rather than who is right.

Adult Principle #10 Try not to forget that, no matter how certain, you might be wrong.

Adult Principle #11 Give up blood sports.

Adult Principles #13 Never lie to anyone for any reason. (Lies of omission are sometimes exempt.)
