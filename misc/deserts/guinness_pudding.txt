Yields: 4 servings
Ingredients

4	large egg yolks
½	cup sugar plus 3 tbsp.
1½	cups Guinness Stout
1¾	cups heavy cream
4	ounces high-quality bittersweet (70 to 72% cacao) chocolate, finely chopped

Directions

In large nonreactive mixing bowl, whisk together egg yolks and ½ cup sugar.

Open can of Guinness and slowly pour into 4-cup measuring cup, pouring down side of cup to reduce foaming. 
Pour ½ cup of Guinness into heavy-bottomed saucepan. Add 1¼ cups cream and whisk to combine. Set over medium 
heat, whisking occasionally, until bubbles just begin to form at edges. Remove from heat, add chocolate and 
whisk until smooth.

Slowly pour hot chocolate mixture into eggs, whisking constantly to prevent curdling. Return mixture to 
saucepan and set over moderately low heat.

Cook, whisking constantly, until mixture thickens. Divide pudding among glasses, leaving at least 1 inch of 
space at top of each. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled and set.

Meanwhile, pour 1 cup of Guinness into small saucepan and bring to boil over medium heat. Reduce heat to 
moderately low and simmer, uncovered, until reduced to 1 tablespoon, about 20 minutes. Pour syrup into small 
bowl and let cool.

Beat remaining cream and 3 tbsp. sugar until soft peaks form. Add 1 tsp. (or more to your liking) of the 
Guinness syrup and beat until combined. Divide cream among 4-6 glasses of pudding and serve.
