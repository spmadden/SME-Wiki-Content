# Pumpkin Pie Cupcakes

For the pumpkin pies you’ll need:

    1 batch of your favorite pie crust dough (Don’t have a favorite? Use pre-made 
         refrigerated dough, it will work well too.)
    1 15 oz. can pumpkin pie filling, prepared according to the can’s directions 
         (or you can make your pie filling from scratch, you overachiever, you—either 
         way, you’ll need enough for one pie).

For the cupcakes you’ll need:

    1 1/2 sticks unsalted butter, room temperature
    8 oz. cream cheese, room temperature
    1 1/2 c. granulated sugar
    3 eggs
    2 t. vanilla
    2 t. baking powder
    1/2 t. baking soda
    1/2 t. salt
    1 1/3 c. whole milk
    2 1/2 c. flour

For the buttercream you’ll need:

    2 sticks unsalted butter, room temperature
    8 oz cream cheese, room temperature
    2 c. powdered sugar
    1 c. Hershey’s cinnamon chips (or any cinnamon chips you like)
    splash of whole milk

Directions:

    Pre-heat the oven to 425 degrees (F).

    First, prepare the pumpkin pies. Mix up the pumpkin pie mix according 
    to the can’s directions (or make your own-fancy!). Roll out the pie 
    crust dough and cut it into small circles that are large enough to cover
    the bottom and sides of mini cupcake tins (I used the opening of a 
    small juice glass as a cutter).

    Press the dough into the lightly greased mini cupcake tins, and then 
    fill them with the pumpkin pie mix. (Don’t go all the way to the top, 
    the filling will expand a little while baking.)

    Bake the pies for about 7 minutes at 425 degrees (F), and then turn the
    oven down to 350 degrees (F) and bake them for another 10 minutes or 
    so, until the crust is brown and the filling is completely set.

    After taking them out of the oven, cool them on a wire rack for about 
    10 minutes, then take them out of the pan and allow them to cool 
    further while you mix up the batter.

    For the cupcake batter, combine the butter and the cream cheese 
    together on medium speed for about 90 seconds—you want the ingredients 
    to be well incorporated. Then mix in the sugar until the mixture is 
    fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time, and then the vanilla, baking soda, 
    baking powder, and salt. Then mix in the milk and the flour, 
    alternating between the two ingredients. Scrape down the sides and 
    bottom of the bowl, to make sure everything is getting well-mixed—beat 
    again on med-high speed for about a minute. It should be smooth and 
    creamy.

    Spoon a heaping tablespoon of batter into regular-sized, paper-lined 
    cupcake tins. Plop a cooled pumpkin pie into the center, and press 
    gently into the batter. GENTLY. You don’t want it to touch to the bottom
    of the pan.

    Cover the pies with another heaping tablespoon of batter, so the top and sides are completely covered.

    Bake at 350 degrees (F) for about 25 minutes, until the cake is set and
    the edges and tops of the cupcakes have turned golden brown.

    Allow them to cool in the cupcake tray for atleast 10 minutes before 
    moving to a wire rack—they’ll be a little fragile at first.

    Once the cakes are cool, frost ‘em!

    To make the buttercream, melt down the cinnamon chips with a splash of 
    whole milk. Pop ‘em in the microwave for about 45 seconds on high. Stir
    until all the chips are melted, and allow it to cool a bit while you 
    whip up the rest of the frosting (you can put the bowl in the fridge, 
    it’ll cool faster that way, and the milk will keep it from 
    solidifying).

    Cream together the butter and cream cheese until they’re well 
    incorporated. Then whip in the powdered sugar, a cup at a time, until 
    the mixture is smooth and creamy. With the mixer on low, drizzle in the 
    cooled cinnamon chip “ganache” (if it’s too hot it’ll melt the 
    buttercream and ruin it—you don’t want that). Put in about half, then 
    stop to taste it and decide if you’d like to add more. Some like it 
    strong, others like it milder.

    If  you have any pie crust left over, roll it out and cut smaller discs
    and sprinkle them with a little bit of cinnamon and sugar. Bake ‘em 
    for about 10 minutes at 350 and look at that, a cute and tasty cupcake 
    topper!

    You can also try candied pecans or a drizzle of caramel on top. Tasty!
