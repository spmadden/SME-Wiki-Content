## An abbreviated and simplified walk-around checklist for all aircraft

* Are all the holes there last time, still there?
  * Is there anything in these holes?  If yes, remove it.
* Are there any new holes?
  * If yes, go back inside - you aren't flying today :(
* Are all the blades that were there last time, still there?
  * If no, go back inside - you aren't flying today :(
* Are all the things that were dry last time still dry and all the things that were wet last time still wet?
  * If no, make the new dry things wet and the new wet things dry.
* Are all the things that were on the plane last flight still on?
  * If no, go back inside - you aren't flying today :(
