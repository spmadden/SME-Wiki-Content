  the wrong thing in the wrong place at the wrong time - but a good plan should keep a concentration
  from forming.

  And even, if circumstances required, a contingency plan for his contingency plans' contingency plan.

====On Intelligence====

====Leadership====
  Leadership is Responsibility, not privilege,
   Action, not position,

   and Outcome, not disposition,
  -- //Dante Shepherd//

  "As a leader, you have to not only do the right thing, but be perceived to be doing the right thing. 
  A consequence of seeking a leadership position is being put under intense public scrutiny, being held 
  to high standards, and enhancing a reputation that is constantly under threat."
  —- //Jeffrey Sonnenfeld and Andrew Ward//
  
====Programming====
  "The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff. He builds his 
  castles in the air, from air, creating by exertion of the imagination. Few media of creation are 
  so flexible, so easy to polish and rework, so readily capable of realizing grand conceptual structures. "
  -- Frederic Brooks, //The Mythical Man Month//

  "What really is the point of trying to teach anything to anybody?"
  This question seemed to provoke a murmur of sympathetic approval from up and down the table.
  Richard continued, "What I mean is that if you really want to understand something, the best 
  way is to try and explain it to   someone else. That forces you to sort it out in your mind. 
  And the more slow and dim-witted your pupil, the more you have to break things down into more 
  and more simple ideas. And that's really the essence of programming. By the time you've sorted 
  out a complicated idea into little steps that even a stupid machine can deal with, you've learned 
  something about it yourself.
  -- //Douglas Adams, Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency//

  And so, IPv6 was born. Since Vint Cerf is probably immortal (even if his physical form should pass on, 
  heaven forbid, he is probably already existing as some kind of hyper-intelligent ELIZA program out in 
  the depths of the Internet2), no one wants to have to hear him say again "I told you so" if we don't 
  have enough addresses in the next version of the Internet Protocol.

  "You're a cook. I don't kill cooks. Although...there was that one time in Boston. But all I'd
  have to do is get the jury to taste his salmon mousse, and there isn't a court in the land that 
  would convict me."
  -- The Shade, "Incident In An Old Haunt" 

  "...He's been callous and charismatic, sick, psychotic and enoumously likable.  In short,
  he's everyone's favorite megalomaniac" 

  "I really wish I could hate you, but I am so in awe of your outright bastardry that I cannot help but

  in my direction is reflected off of me, returns to its original trajectory and adheres to you.
