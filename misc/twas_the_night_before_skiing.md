## Twas the Night before Skiing

    Twas the night before skiing, when all through the house 
    I was the only creature stirring, except for one mouse. 
    My ski bags were packed by the front door with care, 
    Because the mountain was calling and I'd soon be there.  

    I couldn't stay nestled all snug in my bed, 
    Cuz visions of fresh tracks danced around in my head. 
    Newschoolers on my computer, which I had on my lap, 
    Was keeping me from getting my much-needed nap. 

    When outside my window there arose such a clatter, 
    I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter. 
    Away to the window I flew in a dash, 
    Tore open the shutters; I got there in a flash. 

    The moon glimmering behind the falling snow 
    That was quickly covering the objects below. 
    When, below my wide open eyes should appear, 
    But an enormous smile that stretched ear to ear. 

    My lips had sprung up, so lively and quick, 
    I knew in a moment that tomorrow would be sick. 
    More rapid than eagles the snow, down it came, 
    And it whistled, and shouted, it was calling my name! 

    "Now Vail! Now, Alta! Now, Whistler and Jackson! 
    On, Park City! On, Squaw! On Mount Snow and A-Basin! 
    Snow for every mountain! Let it pile tall! 
    Now get your skis! Your boards! Come one, come all!" 

    The snow kept falling, and on the ground it nested, 
    And I decided that it'd be best if I were well-rested. 
    I heard this when I entered my bed and the snow left sight: 
    "Happy skiing to all, and to all a good-night!"
