    Skiiers and snowboarders don't obsess about staying young 
    We simply refuse to grow all the way up
    And we know that there's no such thing as a fountain of youth
    There just might be a mountain of youth, which kinda makes you wonder; 

    "Does it get any snow"?

    We are the children of winter. 
    And we are blessed.
    Blessed to know the thill of speed and the joy of air,
    Blessed to welcome the shortest and coldest days of the year,
    Blessed to run outside when others run inside,
    ...and blessed to realize the world is our playground.
