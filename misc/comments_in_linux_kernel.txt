 * This is a helper routine to autodetect StarTech/Exar/Oxsemi UART's.
 * When this function is called we know it is at least a StarTech
 * 16650 V2, but it might be one of several StarTech UARTs, or one of
 * its clones.  (We treat the broken original StarTech 16650 V1 as a
 * 16550, and why not?  Startech doesn't seem to even acknowledge its
 * existence.)
