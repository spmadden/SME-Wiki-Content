### Do Not Stand At My Grave And Weep

> Do not stand at my grave and weep
> I am not there. I do not sleep.
> I am a thousand winds that blow.
> I am the diamond glints on snow.
> I am the sunlight on ripened grain.
> I am the gentle autumn rain.
> When you awaken in the morning's hush,
> I am the swift uplifting rush
> Of quiet birds in circled flight
> I am the soft stars that shine at night.
> Do not stand at my grave and cry;
> I am not there.
> I did not die.
