# Deep Survival and Resilience

> *I convinced him to take me to work with him so that I could find out what he did, which he didn’t seem able to explain. I’d been after him about it since I was very little, and by the time I was five, I had started to think that he might have been in the slow group at scientist school. All the other fathers could explain what they did.*


> *Yankovich explained it to me: “The launch bar breaks. The shuttle goes supersonic and hits the water brake. The water brake turns instantly to steam from all that energy and explodes. Deck plates come flying up, and you fly right through the deck plates as you take off. So you eject and land on the deck.” That’s what’s known in fighter pilot parlance as “Not your day.”*

> *He used to say, “When you walk across the ramp to your airplane, you lose half your IQ.” I always wondered what he meant, but instinctively I felt it. When I was a new pilot, I’d get so excited before a flight that I’d get tunnel vision. I’d look at a checklist and be unable to read beyond the first item: Check Master Switch—Off.*

> *“When the river has been coming up a foot an hour all night, when it’s gone from clear to chocolate milk, when there are no more eddies and there are 18-inch diameter trees going down at 15 miles an hour, it’s just not a tough decision,” Hough said. But as John F. Kennedy once remarked, “There’s always some son of a bitch who doesn’t get the word.”*

> *In an environment that has high objective hazards, the longer it takes to dislodge the imagined world in favor of the real one, the greater the risk. In nature, adaptation is important; the plan is not. It’s a Zen thing. We must plan. But we must be able to let go of the plan, too.*

> *The word “experienced” often refers to someone who’s gotten away with doing the wrong thing more frequently than you have.*

> *What we call “accidents” do not just happen. There is not some vector of pain that causes them. People have to assemble the systems that make them happen. Even then, nothing may happen for a long time.*

> *When I was a teenager, I teased my father by saying that from living with scientists all my life I had observed that they knew so much that they often seemed to know nothing at all.*

> *Dan Canin of Lockheed wrote in an e-mail, “Every precaution and material science known to man has been applied to the problem of making the thermal protection system work. It’s a known risk. The tiles are soft, and every astronaut knows that if the wrong ones are damaged, the shuttle burns up. But the odds against it are pretty good, especially when compared to the rewards of being an astronaut, so they’re willing to take the chance. In fact, they FIGHT for it…as would a lot of us. But getting the public to buy this is a lot tougher, especially a public that expects every risk in their lives to be mitigatable to zero. It will be interesting to see if NASA tries to take on this challenge, explaining to the public that doing bold things isn’t about engineering risk to zero. Shit happens, and if we just want to restrict ourselves to things where shit can’t happen…we’re not going to do anything very interesting.”*

> *Although there’s wide variation, the rule of thumb is that you can survive three minutes without air, three days without water, and three weeks without food.*

> *“If you made it so safe for everybody to get up there, you’d have a lot more fatalities because people wouldn’t recognize the risk.” More likely, people wouldn’t bother to go up. But we want to go up. We want to conquer. I don’t mind dying. I just don’t want to do it today. And I’d hate like hell to have my gravestone read: “Here lies a moron.”*

> *The survivor plans by setting small, manageable goals and then systematically achieving them. Hence the Air Force checklist and the notion, which my father drilled into me: Plan the flight and fly the plan. But don’t fall in love with the plan. Be open to a changing world and let go of the plan when necessary so that you can make a new plan. Then, as the world and the plan both go through their book of changes, you will always be ready to do the next right thing.*

> *Starting from the moment of the accident, it is necessary for a survivor to take control of his situation. Peter Leschak speaks of “Standard Fire Order #10: Stay alert, keep calm, think clearly, act decisively.” According to this directive, the best way to meet an emergency is with sharp senses (to gather information), a clear mind (to analyze the information), and bold action; add to these humor (to handle strong emotions).*

> *“The best survivors spend almost no time, especially in emergencies, getting upset about what has been lost, or feeling distressed about things going badly…. For this reason they don’t usually take themselves too seriously and are therefore hard to threaten.”*

> *Survivors know, whether they are conscious of it or not, that to live at all is to fly upside down (640 people died in 1999 while choking on food; 320 drowned in the bath tub). You’re already flying upside down. You might as well turn on the smoke and have some fun.*

> *I adhere to what my daughter Amelia calls the Gutter Theory of Life. It goes like this: You don’t want to be lying in the gutter, having been run down by a bus, the last bit of your life ebbing away, and be thinking, “I should have taken that rafting trip…” or, “I should have learned to surf…” or “I should have flown upside down—with smoke!”*

> *Confucius said, “A common man marvels at uncommon things; a wise man marvels at the commonplace.”*

> *When we wave to someone, we show our palm, signaling that we are of the same species, a species that can wave, and showing that we are unarmed. Similarly, when we shake hands in the American way, grabbing each other’s hand firmly, it is a symbolic message of mutual disarmament. You immobilize my hand, and I immobilize yours. By this mutual consent, we have agreed, for the moment, not to kill each other.*

> *Bureaucracies force us to practice nonsense. And if you rehearse nonsense, you may one day find yourself the victim of it.*

> *During Apollo 13, for example, the concept that “failure is not an option” was developed, and the safe return of Apollo 13 served to strengthen the models and the ability of groupness to repel ideas from outside. It also promoted a dangerously wrong idea. For failure, unfortunately, is always an option.*

> *Each of the behaviors that have wound up contributing to our predicament has its origins in a large investment of effort that produced triumphant results. Despite signs of trouble, we adjust our mental models to accommodate larger deviations from the norm.*

> *This is exactly why success is such a dangerous element of any endeavor. Embrace the struggle. Beware the achievement. For it steals your caution even as it leads you down the next unknown pathway.*
