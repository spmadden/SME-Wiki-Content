  Why do we do it?
  Why do we seek out these places?
  We get asked all the time, why?
  Why do we choose to keep coming back time and time again.
  There are just certain places that we all feel drawn to.
  Places with a calling that are impossible to ignore.
  We discover a profound meaning in these places.
  An extraordinary connection with something more than ourselves.
  It doesn't matter who we are, what we do, where we come from.
  We are all consumed by the same curiosity, the same desire to explore the world.
  For us, it's not enough to live life on the edge...
   ...we have to live over it.
  
  It is impossible to explain the magic of these places, the impact that they have on us.
  For us the summit is just the starting point, 
   ...it is the journey on the way down where the adventure truly begins.
   
  WE ARE CANYONEERS.
