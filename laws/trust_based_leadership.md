# Trust Based Leadership

### 1. Human Connections > Business Metrics
> *While KPIs and metrics are important, leaders build genuine relationships. They make the effort to know the person behind the role—understanding their aspirations, their concerns, and what motivates them beyond the numbers.*

### 2. Distribute Decision-Making Power Across All Levels
> *Leaders trust their team enough to let them make their own decisions. I've repeatedly found that empowering your people builds their confidence, inspires them to be creative, and makes them accountable.*

### 3. Come Down to Their Level
> *Leaders adapt to each team member's unique needs. Flexible work, personalized feedback, whatever it is… meet people where they are if you want them to thrive.*

### 4. There is Power in Vulnerability
> *Leaders are transparent about struggles and uncertainties. I've learned that being open about my own challenges and seeking help when I need it builds trust. You share, you grow.*

### 5. Identify And Celebrate Diversity
> *A high-performing team is also a well-rounded team. Identify and nurture each member’s strengths and create a space where they feel safe to contribute. Their varied perspectives and skills will only help you thrive.*

### 6. Create Purpose-Driven Work
> *Your people are inspired when they understand how their contributions shape the bigger picture. Help them find meaning in their work and they will champion your business.*

> **Leadership is not just about achieving outcomes but about enriching the lives of those you lead. And that can only happen by leading with compassion, kindness, and empathy.**
