The laws are really simple basic truths that arise in typical engineering discussions. We didn't hear them in engineering school but they came through loud and clear in that school of hard knocks, the engineering project. 

Physical laws like Maxwell's Equations are brief and elegant. Newton's three laws are so simple and yet so profound. Beautiful. Technical disciplines, on the other hand, collect brief statements that capture the essence of that discipline. Sometimes in a cynical nature but many times right on the mark. 

Thermodynamics can be captured by three "laws":
  - You can't win.
  - You can't break even.
  - You can't even quit the game.

==== THE THREE LAWS OF SYSTEMS ENGINEERING ====

Many such laws relating to Systems Engineering come to mind for the various activities of the Systems Engineering process. These simple statements hold the meaning of an activity in a way that is easy to remember and forms a guiding principle. 

** The First Law: **
  Everything interacts with everything else.

** The Second Law: **
  Everything goes somewhere.

** The Third Law: **
  There is no such thing as a free lunch.


=== Decomposition ===
The first law seems to be at odds with the principle of decomposition where we decompose a large complicated problem into a number of smaller complicated problems and so on until we have reduced the problem to a manageable size where a few people can get around the problem. The idea is to break things apart at simple and clean interfaces so that after solving the piece parts we can assemble things in a simple and easy manner into a final solution. Decomposing systems in the simplest way is an art but we should not forget that impacts ripple throughout the system and can never be ignored.
===Interfaces ===
The second law deals with the multiple interfaces we have exposed in the decomposition. The interfaces have to be consistent and account for all things generated like control signals, communications, as well as thermal loads, EMI, power spikes, etc. We must account for everything at the interface and follow where it goes. If it leaves some place, then it must arrive someplace else.
===Trade Studies===
The third law deals with trade studies and the whole act of system synthesis. Never become so enamored with a design decision that you forget the down side of that decision. This third law is the law of decision analysis.

==== THE SIMPLE TRUTHS ====
The following laws treat the various lower level considerations that support the three laws above. Maybe they are not laws but only simple truths. These simple truths are what guide up along the systems engineering process.

**The fourth Law:**

    Never confuse change with progress.
