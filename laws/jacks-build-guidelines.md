#### Background: 
These are a collection of lessons I have learned thus far in my career that I want to
share with you all. If you like them, great. If you don’t, that is alright too. If it sparks an interesting
thought or conversation that’s fantastic. Also note that these are in no particular order.

#### 1. *Being a Kind & Empathetic Person is invaluable* 
You never really know what is going on in the background with your teammates and co-workers. We all lead different lives and may be impacted by things going on outside of the workplace. Trying your best to be kind, helpful, and empathetic to your teammates, even in times of pressure and stress can mean a lot to them and help you reflect positively on the situation later.

#### 2. Take a Walk – We all get overwhelmed.
Either from schedule stress, doing too many things at once, or maybe even a spicy meeting. Take a lap or two around the building does wonders for me. If I am ever frustrated and about to fire off an email, usually a walk before helps me settle and improve the content of that email.

#### 3. Include Technicians
I made the mistake as a fresh-out engineer of thinking that engineers know everything and technicians perform the work that the engineers say to perform. This is obviously wrong. Technicians have a deep and wide breath of knowledge in their trade and skill set. Including technicians in discussions that involve those skill sets will help you learn as an engineer and develop a bond with your peers.

#### 4. Explain why we do things
When you get support from a variety of support teams (techs, welders, riggers, shipping, finance, procurement, etc) it goes a long way to quickly explain what their help means in the larger context. Especially at a company where we all support the core mission, this engagement helps keep the energy high. Remember to bring the techs along with you mentally even when the pace picks up.

#### 5. Everything above the floor takes longer than you think
Do what you can to minimize work scope at height in any process you setup. The overhead costs of lifts, fall protection, forgotten tools, access and training adds up. My data point is the same job averaged out over 10 occurrences takes 8 times longer in a boom lift than on ones feet. 

#### 6. Always have a plan in the field
Anytime you go out to the floor, try and have a plan. Think about what steps you plan to take and challenge yourself to think through what you will need to succeed. I have wasted days of my work life not thinking my task through and forgetting tools or realizing I needed a measurement from CAD back at my desk. Even writing it out forces you to think what you need. This becomes easier with experience.

#### 7. Work Blocks Work 
As project extreme owners we need to think critically about a unique problem every day. This is not easy to start. It is impossible if you have to switch between meetings and project work every 45 minutes or so. Do what you can to carve out a real block of time (3+ hours) to complete work everyday. This will become more of a watch item when we are on the floor daily.

#### 8. Avoid saying ‘Just’
There is a high correlation between someone saying “why don’t you just…” and that person getting immediately disagreed with. Saying just in this context may not seem like it but it immediately undermines the work and thought process of the person you are saying it to. Try out “would you be open to….” or “have you considered…”

#### 9. Avoid Hero Shifts in Production
We need to think critically every day. Losing sleep to work hero shifts has short term gain followed by pain. The personal pain comes in the form ofbeing tired and thus making less good decisions. The team pain comes when we are out on the floor and supporting each other in different disciplines. If you are not present because you worked late, the rest of the team will be less effective. 

#### 10. Execute on what you can control, escalate what you cannot
Don’t stress about things you cannot control, escalate them to people in your leadership chain. Execute on the items you can control, and you will not be stressed. Note that it takes trust for the escalation part to work, this takes time. 

#### 11. Challenge yourself and your requirements
Be able to justify to yourself why you are spending time on a task. If it seems unnecessary or not useful, talk to your chain about it, there’s a good chance we can change the rule or requirement. This keeps you efficient and excited. If you didn’t believe in the purpose of your work, you probably wouldn’t have applied to CFS in the first place.

#### 12. Identify what makes you tick
For me, I learned I am engaged by completing small discrete tasks. Taking a big project, making a list and crossing it off every day is how I stay organized, stay on task, and stay excited. That sweet dopamine hit of crossing something off makes my day. Find out what works for you and use that to organize your workday or work style.

#### 13. Avoid bragging about stress
While it feels good in the short term, the comments create the exact environment we as a group want to avoid. If we compete on who is more stressed, we will continue to do more stressful things that we should otherwise be working to avoid. For example, if you are up late every night, focus on efficiency to break the trend, not telling your peers how crazy late you worked the night before.
