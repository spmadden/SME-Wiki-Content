# The Zen of Infosec
*By Jan Shaumann*

> Boring is better than clever.

> Explicit is better than implicit.

> Simple is better than complex.

> Complex is better than complicated.

> Fail closed is better than fail open.

> Layers are better than bulwarks.

> Usability counts.

> Integrity without authenticity is rarely what you want.

> Although confidentiality without authenticity may be ok.

> Shamir's Three Laws still hold.

> And Kerckhoff's Principle extends beyond pure crypto.

> In the face of an audit, refuse the temptation to tick checkboxes.

> Hanlon's Razor is sharp as ever.

> Although that may not be obvious if you've been here for a while.

> 100% security is impossible.

> Although raising the bar is often sufficient.

> If the system is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.

> If the system is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.

> Threat models are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
