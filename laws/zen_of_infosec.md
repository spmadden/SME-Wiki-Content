# The Zen of Infosec
*Originally By Jan Shaumann*

> 1. Boring is better than clever.

> 2. Explicit is better than implicit.

> 3. Simple is better than complex.

> 4. Complex is better than complicated.

> 5. Failing closed is better than failing open.

> 6. Layers are better than bulwarks.

> 7. Usability counts.

> 8. Integrity without authenticity is rarely what you want.

> 9. ...although confidentiality without authenticity may be ok.

> 10. [Shamir's Three Laws](/laws/laws_of_software_engineering#shamirs-3-laws-of-cryptography) still hold.

> 11. And [Kerckhoff's Principle](/laws/laws_of_software_engineering#kerchkhoffs-principle) extends beyond pure crypto.

> 12. In the face of an audit, refuse the temptation to tick checkboxes.

> 13. [Hanlon's Razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon's_razor) is sharp as ever.

> 14. ...although that may not be obvious if you've been here for a while.

> 15. 100% security is impossible.

> 16. ...although raising the bar is often sufficient.

> 17. If the system is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.

> 18. If the system is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.

> 19. Threat models are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
