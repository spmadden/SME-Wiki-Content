# Things I Know To Be True

> 1. **It's possible to commit no mistakes and still lose.**
  That's not a failure, nor is that a weakness - that's life.  There is no magic right answer, but there sure is a lot of wrong answers out there.  Perfection isn't achievable, but we can always be looking towards it, and moving towards it.

> 2. **Even the most money, biggest market, or best story won't bend the laws of nature.**
  Hoping for miracles is not good risk management.  We should be ambitious, explain our vision clearly, and gather resources to execute while respecting the immutable laws of the universe.  Basing a vision around flawed assumptions is a guaranteed path to failure.  
  
> 3. **A testable hypothesis is the most powerful idea in the world.**
  THe best way to advance is to try and test our ideas.  The rate at which we progress will depend on how fact we can iterate over the right learning cycles.  This approach must be rigorously data-driven, full of impartial observation, and performed with focus.  Hypothesis testing and incorporating what is learned is critical to success in science, engineering, and life.
  
> 4. **In order for technology to work, it must work for everyone.**
  Even if a technology functions and is affordable, systems and society can react in unexpected ways.  The environmentalist is just as important as the technologist.  The neighbor is just as important as the shareholder.  Technology is beyond simply hardware or software, it is a story that must be compelling and told in a way that is truthful and moving.  If the public does not accept the technology, it has failed.  If investors don't understand the technology, it has failed.
  
> 5. **An open intellectual environment is the most effective.**
  Clear expression and critique of ideas is the fastest, surest way to solve problems.  The more great minds engaged in thinking about a problem, the better.  Smart people come from all different types of organizations, even unexpected ones, and an open intellectual environment will facilitate the involvement of as many of them as possible.  If something is interesting and impactful (and people know about it), they will work on it.
  
> 6. **Favor robustness over fragility, simplicity over complexity, flexibility over rigidity, small over big.**
  The world is fundamentally uncertain and dynamic, that's what makes it great.  Any successful technology must be able to adapt to changing conditions.  It's better to put effort into making things resilient than making them work better only where they are today.  The most effective teams are continually reinventing themselves, accepting new ideas openly, and questioning held assumptions.  This dynamic attracks the best and brightest people.
  
> 7. **The path is as important as the destination.**
  Great ideas with no way to take the next step go nowhere.  Learning cycles, managing risk, building the right team, and creating opportunities are all important to getting from here to there.  Even if the final product is feasible and attractive, the failure ofa n intermediate step will break the cahin, and it is better to fidn the weak links as early as possible.  Thus, the most responsible path retires the largest risks as early, at as low a cost, and with the smallest team as possible.  No plan may survive first contact with the enemy, but planning is essential.
  
> 8. **Innovate always, everywhere, on a log scale.**
  The world is constantly changing, creating new opportunities and threats.  An incremental approach is not good enough to survive, let alone make leaps.  You do not go to space by growing incrementally taller trees.  We will always be looking at the whole system, challenging assumptions and finding new approaches, tools, and talents to make the system better.  When choosing what to work on, we will find the biggest levers and pull them the hardest.
