# SPM's Laws of Software Engineering

These are a collection of rules/laws/axioms I've come to follow during my career as an Engineer.  Each has a story behind it.  These are all compatible with [SPM's Rules of Engagement](/laws/spms-roes) in spirit, if not to the letter.


## The 1st Axiom: Nearly all problems in Engineering are People Problems, not Science Problems.

> Science is easy.  People are hard.  Engineering is done to improve the lives of people - your customers.  

### Axiom 1.1: People are Fickle

> fickle /fĭk′əl/ (adj): Not fixed or firm; liable to change; unstable; of a changeable mind; not firm in opinion or purpose; inconstant; capricious. 
> See also: unstable, inconstant, ambiguous, erratic, ambivalent, impulsive, impermanent

### Axiom 1.2: Schedule, Budget, Staffing, and Prioritization are the hardest problems you'll never solve.
> The best design in the world will always be overridden by the "Magic 4":
> * We don't have the schedule because...
> * Other tasks hare higher priority because...
> * We don't have spare staffing because...
> * We don't have spare budget because...

## The 1st Law: Know Who Your Customer Is

> If you're improving the lives of your customers, you need to know who your customer is.  Maintain a good and continuous
 

## The Law: Growth is Essential
> Always be working towards something larger, bigger, better, faster.
