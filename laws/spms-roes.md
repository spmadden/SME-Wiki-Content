# SPM's ROEs

In order of precedence.  Don't violate ROE #0 to meet any other ROE.

## 0. Don't do stupid, and don't permit stupid to happen.
> *It will invariably happen - the [Second Law of Thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy#Second_law_of_thermodynamics) guarantees the trend towards chaos unless a conscious effort is made to stop it.  Be that conscious effort.*

> Corrolaries:
> * You may not always know what the right answer is - but most of the time you know what the **wrong** answer is.  
> * Don't do the wrong thing, or let the wrong thing to come to pass.  
> * Don't know what the right answer is?  Make your best guess.  Test it. Learn from it.  Iterate until you reach an acceptable destination.
> * Design. Build. Test. Learn. Iterate.

## 1. Maintain situational awareness at all times.
> *Whether it's engineering, recreation, or simply lounging about - knowing that stupid is brewing is the first step in preventing stupid from happening.*

## 2. Know where all the bodies (or documents, or information) are buried.
> *You don't need to know all the answers, you just need to know how to **find** all the answers.  There is **always** too much going on to maintain perfect SA.  When you fall behind - know how to get caught up.* 

## 3. Write everything down and hoard it (in a spot you control) like a squirrel hoards nuts for the winter.
> *Brains, like all storage media, are fallible and routinely fail.  Making backups of your brain is just as critical as making backups of your hard drive.*
> Corollaries:
> * A picture is worth 1000 words.  People think in pictures.  Draw it out or take a quick snap of it.

## 4. Some things on the internet last forever - other things, not so much.
  
> *Maintain local/offline copies of critical documents - you never know when some industrious engineer is going to refactor the server storing the manuals for that one device you bought 10 years ago and delete that one file.  Buy a device?  Stash all the vendor docs locally.*
> * PDF Manuals
> * PDF Data Sheets
> * Export Wiki Pages as PDFs
> * Executable Installers
> * If the vendor makes it available on their site - pull it down.
>
> When you fail (and you will fail) - the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/) is a godsend.

## 5. Spread the Wealth.
> *All that information you have at your fingertips?  Make it accesible to those who need it, and who aren't following these ROEs themselves.*

## 6. Be a force to be reckoned with.
> *Your name shouldn't be used as a curse, but folks should think twice about crossing you.*

## 7. Be a force-multipler for those around you.
> *Remove roadblocks.  Accelerate & enable those around you to do bigger, better, grander things, faster.*

## 8. Be the change you wish to see in the world.
> *If you build it, they (he) will come.  If not you, then who?  Set the example for those around you for how you wish they would act - don't drop to their level.  See someone setting a better example than you?  Rise to their level.*

## 9. In a grey area? Ask for forgiveness, not permission.
> *But be damn sure to bring results with you.*

## 10. Nothing is more permanent than something "temporary"
> *Don't accept below-standard work because it is "temporary".  What you think is temporary now frequently becomes permanent*

## 11. Slow is pro. Be deliberate in your actions.  Get it right the first time.
> *Sprinting headlong into action makes you look like a hero.  It frequently also sets you up for critical failure because you were missing a critical fact or bit of information.*

## 12. Don't let "perfection" be the enemy of "good enough", but don't let "good enough" stop you for reaching for "perfection".
> *Have a good understanding of the requirements and exit criteria.  Know when something is 'good enough' for action.  Be wary of ROE0 and ROE10 - they'll bite you here good.*

## 13. Make every action count.
> *Every action you take builds a foundation for all your future actions.  Be deliberate in your actions and lay a good foundation.  Not every plan must manifest quickly - have long term plans, even if vague and undefined.  You may not know how to get there today - but you will eventually.*

## 14. Choose your battles.
> *You won't win them all.  You will fail.  Remember the Serenity Prayer and keep it wholly.*

> *Grant me the Strength to change the things that I can, the Serenity to accept the things I cannot, and the Wisdom to know the difference.*

## 15. Fight every battle you can.
> *Just because failure is always an option, doesn't meen you have to accept it.  Fight the good fight - die on that anthill, and remember Calvin's Prayer and keep it wholly.*

> *Grant me the Strength to change the things that I can, the Inability to accept what I cannot, and the Incapacity to tell the difference.*

## 16. Know when to be the "Limiting Factor"
> *Don't be the reason things didn't go right because you didn't do everything you could.*

> *Sometimes you just have to pump the brakes and refuse to let something pass uncriticized to prevent stupid from happening*
