# Fundamental Laws of Engineering

### The First Law
> The correct order is: debug, then ship.

### The Second Law
> If it isn't broken, don't fix it.

### The Third Law
> If you fiddle with something long enough, it will break.

### The Fourth Law
> It works better if you plug it in.

### The Fifth Law
> If it's wedged, power-cycle it.

### The Sixth Law
> A working example is worth a thousand manual pages.

### The Seventh Law
> Failures occur where two parts join.

### The Eighth Law
> Demos cause failures.

### The Ninth Law
> Systems grow more complex with time.

### The Tenth Law
> If it's too complex, rebuild it.

### The Eleventh Law
> Small parts vanish when dropped.

### The Twelfth Law
> Don't build from components what you can buy pre-packaged for less.
