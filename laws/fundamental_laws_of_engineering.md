# Fundamental Laws of Engineering

> First Law: The correct order is: debug, then ship.

> Second Law: If it isn't broken, don't fix it.

> Third Law: If you fiddle with something long enough, it will break.

> Fourth Law: It works better if you plug it in.

> Fifth Law: If it's wedged, power-cycle it.

> Sixth Law: A working example is worth a thousand manual pages.

> Seventh Law: Failures occur where two parts join.

> Eighth Law: Demos cause failures.

> Ninth Law: Systems grow more complex with time.

> Tenth Law: If it's too complex, rebuild it.

> Eleventh Law: Small parts vanish when dropped.

> Twelfth Law: Don't build from components what you can buy pre-packaged for less.
