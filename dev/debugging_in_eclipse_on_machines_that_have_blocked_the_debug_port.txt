=====Debugging in Eclipse on machines that have blocked the Debug Port=====
Create a new Run configuration called 'Project-debug'

In the JVM Options, add the following line
<code>
  -Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address={addr}
</code>
Where {addr} is a port that you have listen access on.

The SSE has opened port 1527 for listening.


Create a new Remote Debug configuration called 'Project-Debug'
  Select 'Standard (Socket Attach)'
  Select host localhost
  Select port {addr} from above

Start the Run configuration first, you should see the following line:
  Listening for transport dt_socket at address: {addr}
Start the Debug configuration next, then debug as usual.
