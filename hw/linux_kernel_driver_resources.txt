====== Resources I've compiled while dealing with the Linux Kernel ======

   "Once you realize that documentation should be laughed at, peed upon, put
  on fire, and just ridiculed in general, THEN, and only then, have you reached
  the level where you can safely read it and try to use it to actually implement
  a driver."
  
  	- Linus Torvalds

First off - the best location for information about how the kernel does things is the /Documentation/ folder right in the source tree.  Best source yet.
