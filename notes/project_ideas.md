## Project Ideas

##### SSH Router

An SSH daemon that acts as a router between multiple other SSH clients (think SSH proxy)

#### RTL-SDR Dongle setup

Get an RTL-SDR dongle (either USB or PCI) up and working

Use this for the following:

-   ADS-B Aircraft data reciever
    -   Plot this data in WorldWinds?
-   GPS Receiver
-   [NOAA HRPT weather images](/projects/NOAA HRPT weather images)
