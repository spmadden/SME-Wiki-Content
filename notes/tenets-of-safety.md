# Tenets of Safety

> *tenet* (n): a principle, belief, or doctrine generally held to be true

## 1. Hazard recognition is the foundation
The hazards of our work are not intuitive. We cannot control hazards we do not
recognize. We must train workers to develop and maintain hazard recognition skills.

## 2. Injuries result from contact with Energy.
Injuries result from exposure to one of ten energy sources. The higher the energy level,
the greater the potential consequence. We must control energy to prevent injuries.

## 3. Good is better than lucky.
Failure will occur. It is not if, but when. If we complete high risk work without
incident, were we good or lucky? We must plan and execute work as if failure is
going to happen today.

## 4. Learning must be deliberate.
Learning is a strategic and operational choice towards improvement. There is as
much to learn from normal, successful work as from failure. We must embrace a
culture of continuous learning.

## 5. Error is normal.
Error is not a choice. Error is part of the human condition. 

## 6. Failure can occur safely.
It's not if, it's when.  We will always plan and execute our work as if failure is 
going to happen today. We understand that even our best people make mistakes. We must 
impliment error tolerant controls.

## 6. Trust is essential.
The best safety cultures are built on trust. We cannot learn from failures that go
unreported. We must ensure it is safe to share both positive and negative information.

## 7. Blame fixes nothing.
You can either blame and punish or learn and improve, but you cannot do both.
Blame is the enemy of improvement. “Blame, shame, and retrain” is not an effective
mitigation. We must focus on what failed and not who failed when failure occurs.

## 8. Less is more.
A simple, well executed plan is more effective than a technically superior but poorly
executed one.

## 9. Risk is never static.
Change is normal and expected, but every change can introduce risk. We must
follow a robust change management process to ensure controls remain effective.

## 10. Sometimes safety is inconvenient.
Risk assessment and work planning tools are interrupters by design. We must
intentionally take pause to recognize and control hazards.

## 11. How we react matters.
Our reaction to failure shapes how the organization learns. Excessive reactions can
be as harmful to our safety culture as under reacting. Caring about others is not
enough. We must care for others.
