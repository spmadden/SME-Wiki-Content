## Projects Given to Reqs & Specs Students

### One: Flight Path Navigational Simulator

##### Description:

    We have a UAV payload pod that contains a Electro-Optical Infrared
    (EO/IR) imaging system.  Currently the way we test the positioning
    system is to strap the pod to a Black Hawk (UH-60) and fly it around
    our test facility - we then compare the location taken on the images
    to the location the GPS reported.  If they are similar, we call it a
    success.  We'd like to develop a method of injecting "canned" flight
    paths into the pod in such a way that we can now test it on the
    ground.

### Two: Satellite Positioning System

##### Description:

    We're building a new satellite communiation system to talk with our
    troops overseas.  The new satellite will be in a Molniya style orbit
    around the earth at an orbital inclination of 63.4 degrees above the
    equatorial plane.  We need to develop a simulator to determine the
    look angles from any position on the ground to the satellite and align
    the antennas appropriately.

### Three: New UAV Command System

##### Description:

    A few weeks ago, we captured an Bekibekistanstani UCAV (Unmanned
    Combat Aerial Vehicle) that happened to stray into our airspace.
    Most UAVs in general use what's known as 'Fly-by-wire', in that
    they require a human pilot to fly it remotely.  What is unusual 
    about the design of this UCAV is that we discovered it to be 
    completely autonomous.  Commands were uploaded to it remotely
    via 'waypoints' and 'tasks'.  Typical waypoints included 
    'Fly to here' and "Don't fly here" (also known as 'No-Fly-Zones')
    while typical tasks included 'Take Picture', 'Listen for Radio',
    and 'Fire Missile'.  We've been asked to build a mock-up of this
    command and control system for both the ground-control segment 
    and the air-execute segment.  We have at your disposal the 
    Communications satellite described by 'Project Two' so that
    it can relay your commands the world over.
